        <h2>1. Modern History Of Chichén Itzá</h2>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; C</span>hichén Itzá entered the popular imagination in 1843 with the book Incidents of Travel in Yucatan by John Lloyd Stephens (with illustrations by Frederick Catherwood). The book recounted Stephens' visit to Yucatán and his tour of Maya cities, including Chichén Itzá. The book prompted other explorations of the city. In 1860, Désiré Charnay surveyed Chichén Itzá and took numerous photographs that he published in Cités et ruines américaines (1863).</p>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; V</span>isitors to Chichén Itzá during the 1870s and 1880s came with photographic equipment and recorded more accurately the condition of several buildings.[32] In 1875, Augustus Le Plongeon and his wife Alice Dixon Le Plongeon visited Chichén, and excavated a statue of a figure on its back, knees drawn up, upper torso raised on its elbows with a plate on its stomach. Augustus Le Plongeon called it "Chaacmol" (later renamed "Chac Mool", which has been the term to describe all types of this statuary found in Mesoamerica). Teobert Maler and Alfred Maudslay explored Chichén in the 1880s and both spent several weeks at the site and took extensive photographs. Maudslay published the first long-form description of Chichen Itza in his book, Biologia Centrali-Americana.</p>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; I</span>n 1894, the United States Consul to Yucatán, Edward Herbert Thompson, purchased the Hacienda Chichén, which included the ruins of Chichen Itza. For 30 years, Thompson explored the ancient city. His discoveries included the earliest dated carving upon a lintel in the Temple of the Initial Series and the excavation of several graves in the Osario (High Priest's Temple). Thompson is most famous for dredging the Cenote Sagrado (Sacred Cenote) from 1904 to 1910, where he recovered artifacts of gold, copper and carved jade, as well as the first-ever examples of what were believed to be pre-Columbian Maya cloth and wooden weapons. Thompson shipped the bulk of the artifacts to the Peabody Museum at Harvard University.</p>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; I</span>n 1913, the Carnegie Institution accepted the proposal of archeologist Sylvanus G. Morley and committed to conduct long-term archeological research at Chichen Itza.[33] The Mexican Revolution and the following government instability, as well as World War I, delayed the project by a decade.</p>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; T</span>he layout of Chichén Itzá site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between 750 and 900 AD.[19] Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a regional capital controlling the area from central Yucatán to the north coast, with its power extending down the east and west coasts of the peninsula.[20] The earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at Chichen Itza is equivalent to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998</p>

        <h2>2. Name and orthography</h2>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; C</span>hichén Itzá is a Mayan name: "Chi" is mouth or edge, "ch'en" is well or cave, and Itzá is the name of the people who settled in the area. The name is often translated as "at the mouth of the well of the Itza". This derives from chi', meaning "mouth" or "edge", and ch'e'en, meaning "well". Itzá is the name of the ethnic-lineage group that gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula.</p>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; T</span>he name "Chichén Itzá" has a variety of translations, including "Boca del pozo de los brujos de agua" (Mouth of the well of the water sorcerers). This suggests that the site was believed to be a place of magic and sorcery. The name is spelled Chichén Itzá in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the Maya orthography, Chichen Itza' (pronounced [tʃitʃen itsaʔ] in Yucatec Maya).</p>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; T</span>he name "Chichén Itzá" is currently used by the indigenous Maya people of the Yucatán Peninsula to refer to the archaeological site. It is also the name of a nearby town on the highway from Valladolid to Mérida, and the name of a large municipality that surrounds the town. The archaeological site is located in the municipality of Tinum, in the Mexican state of Yucatán.</p>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; T</span>he name is spelled Chichén Itzá in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the modern Maya orthography, Chichʼen Itzaʼ (pronounced [tʃitʃʼen itsáʔ]). This form preserves the phonemic distinction between chʼ and ch, since the base word chʼeʼen (which, however, is not stressed in Maya) begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant. Traditional Yucatec Maya spelling in Latin letters, used from the 16th through mid 20th century, spelled it as "Chichen Itza" (as accents on the last syllable are usual for the language, they are not indicated as they are in Spanish). The word "Itzaʼ" has a high tone on the "a" followed by a glottal stop (indicated by the apostrophe)</p>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; E</span>vidence in the Chilam Balam books indicates another, earlier name for this city prior to the arrival of the Itza hegemony in northern Yucatán. While most sources agree the first word means seven, there is considerable debate as to the correct translation of the rest. This earlier name is difficult to define because of the absence of a single standard of orthography, but it is represented variously as Uuc Yabnal ("Seven Great House"),[7] Uuc Hab Nal ("Seven Bushy Places"),[8] Uucyabnal ("Seven Great Rulers")[2] or Uc Abnal ("Seven Lines of Abnal").[nb 3] This name, dating to the Late Classic Period, is recorded both in the book of Chilam Balam de Chumayel and in hieroglyphic texts in the ruins.</p>

        <h2>3. Location</h2>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; C</span>hichén Itzá is located in the eastern portion of Yucatán state in Mexico. The northern Yucatán Peninsula is karst, and the rivers in the interior all run underground. There are four visible, natural sink holes, called cenotes, that could have provided plentiful water year round at Chichen, making it attractive for settlement. Of these cenotes, the "Cenote Sagrado" or "Sacred Cenote" (also variously known as the Sacred Well or Well of Sacrifice), is the most famous.[11] In 2015, scientists determined that there is a hidden cenote under the Temple of Kukulkan, which has never been seen by archeologists.</p>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; A</span>ccording to post-Conquest sources (Maya and Spanish), pre-Columbian Maya sacrificed objects and human beings into the cenote as a form of worship to the Maya rain god Chaac. Edward Herbert Thompson dredged the Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910, and recovered artifacts of gold, jade, pottery and incense, as well as human remains.A study of human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice</p>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; T</span>he archeological site is located in the municipality of Tinum, in the Mexican state of Yucatán. It is located about 120 km east of Mérida, the capital of Yucatán, and about 75 km east of the beach city of Progreso. The archaeological site is located within the property of a large ranch, Hacienda Chichen, which was acquired by the Barbachano family in the 19th century. The Barbachanos still own the property, and have allowed the land around the monument to be developed. The land is now a resort, and the owners continue to work with the INAH to preserve the history and culture of the site.</p>

        <h2>4. Architecture</h2>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; T</span>he architecture of Chichen Itza shows a multitude of styles, reminding of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.</p>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; A</span>rchaeologists have identified one central Mexican style area in the north group of buildings, and a Puuc style area in the south group. The presence of the central Mexican style was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion. The buildings of Chichen Itza are grouped in a series of architectonic sets, and each set was at one time separated from the other by a series of low walls. The three best known of these complexes are the Great North Platform, which includes the monuments of El Castillo, Temple of Warriors and the Great Ball Court; The Osario Group, which includes the pyramid of Kukulkan and the Temple of Xtoloc; and the Central Group, which includes the Caracol, Las Monjas, and Akab Dzib.</p>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; T</span>he Temple of Kukulkan is an iconic step-pyramid that dominates the ancient city. The temple is aligned astronomically. Each face of the pyramid has a stairway with 91 steps, which together with the shared step at the top, add up to 365 steps (the number of days of the Haab' year). The structure is 24 m (79 ft) high, plus an additional 6 m (20 ft) for the temple. The square base measures 55.3 m (181 ft) across. The temple is one of the last, and arguably the most visually striking, of all Mayan pyramids. It was built at the end of the early Classic period, and used throughout the rest of the Classic period.</p>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; T</span>he Temple of the Warriors complex consists of a large stepped pyramid fronted and flanked by rows of carved columns depicting warriors. This complex is analogous to Temple B at the Toltec capital of Tula, and indicates some form of cultural contact between the two regions. The one at Chichen Itza, however, was constructed on a larger scale. At the top of the stairway on the pyramid's summit (and leading towards the entrance of the pyramid's temple) is a Chac Mool. This is a type of statue that is also often associated with the Toltecs and is also found in the central Mexican site of Tula. The figure is reclining, with the head up and turned to one side, holding a tray over the stomach. The Chichen Itza Chac Mool is a figure with outstretched arms, holding a bowl.</p>
        <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; T</span>he Great Ball Court is the largest and best preserved ball court in ancient Mesoamerica. It measures 168 by 70 metres (551 by 230 ft). The parallel platforms flanking the main playing area are each 95 metres (312 ft) long. The walls of these platforms stand 8 metres (26 ft) high; set high up in the walls of the Great Ball Court are slanted benches with sculpted panels of teams of ball players. In one panel, one of the players has been decapitated, and from the wound emits seven streams of blood; six of these become wriggling serpents. At the base of the high interior walls are slanted benches with sculpted panels of ball players. A small area at the north end of the Great Ball Court has uncovered several burials, and long-nosed chacmools were also found here.</p>
