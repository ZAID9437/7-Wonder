    <h2>1.History of COLOSSEM</h2>
    <h4>Construction, inauguration, and Roman renovations</h4>
    <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; T</span>he site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine Hills, through which a canalised stream ran as well as an artificial lake/marsh.[17] By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited. It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, following which Nero seized much of the area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes. The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea.</p>
    <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594;  A</span>lthough the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre. Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea. Vespasian's decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other amphitheatres, which were on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre, in effect, placing it both symbolically and geographically at the heart of Rome.</p><hr>


    <h2>2.Construction </h2>
    <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; C</span>onstruction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the First Jewish–Roman War in 70 AD led to the Siege of Jerusalem. According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site, "the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general's share of the booty." It is often assumed that Jewish prisoners of war were brought back to Rome and contributed to the massive workforce needed for the construction of the amphitheatre. This claim is disputed; it would, nonetheless, be commensurate with Roman practice to add humiliation to the defeated population.[19] Along with this free source of unskilled labor, teams of professional Roman builders, engineers, artists, painters and decorators undertook the more specialized tasks necessary for building the Colosseum. The Colosseum was constructed with several different materials: wood, limestone, tuff, tiles, cement, and mortar.</p>
    <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; C</span>onstruction of the Colosseum began under the rule of Vespasian[3] in around 70–72 AD (73–75 AD according to some sources). The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian's death in 79. The top level was finished by his son, Titus, in 80,[3] and the inaugural games were held in 80 or 81 AD.[20] Dio Cassius recounts that over 9,000 wild animals were killed during the inaugural games of the amphitheatre. Commemorative coinage was issued celebrating the inauguration.[21] The building was remodelled further under Vespasian's younger son, the newly designated Emperor Domitian, who constructed the hypogeum, a series of tunnels used to house animals and slaves. He also added a gallery to the top of the Colosseum to increase its seating capacity</p>
    <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; I</span>n 217, the Colosseum was badly damaged by a major fire (caused by lightning, according to Dio Cassius[23]), which destroyed the wooden upper levels of the amphitheatre's interior. It was not fully repaired until about 240 and underwent further repairs in 250 or 252 and again in 320. Honorius banned the practice of gladiator fights in 399 and again in 404. Gladiatorial fights are last mentioned around 435.[18] An inscription records the restoration of various parts of the Colosseum under Theodosius II and Valentinian III (reigned 425–455), possibly to repair damage caused by a major earthquake in 443; more work followed in 484[24] and 508. The arena continued to be used for contests well into the 6th century. Animal hunts continued until at least 523, when Anicius Maximus celebrated his consulship with some venationes, criticised by King Theodoric the Great for their high cost</p>

    <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; T</span>he Colosseum was used to host gladiatorial shows as well as a variety of other events. The shows, called munera, were always given by private individuals rather than the state. They had a strong religious element but were also demonstrations of power and family prestige and were immensely popular. Another major attraction was the animal hunt, or venatio. This utilized a great variety of wild beasts, mainly imported from Africa and the Middle East, and included creatures such as rhinoceros, hippopotamuses, elephants, giraffes, aurochs, wisents, Barbary lions, panthers, leopards, bears, Caspian tigers, crocodiles and ostriches. Battles and hunts were often staged amid elaborate sets with movable trees and buildings. These events could be huge in scale; Trajan is said to have celebrated his victories in Dacia in 107 with contests involving 11,000 animals and 10,000 gladiators over the course of 123 days. During lunch intervals, executions ad bestias would be staged. Those condemned to death would be sent into the arena, naked and unarmed, to face the beasts of death which would literally tear them to pieces. Acrobats and magicians would also perform, usually during the intervals.</p>
    <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; D</span>uring the early days of the Colosseum, ancient writers recorded that the building was used for naumachiae (more properly known as navalia proelia) or simulated sea battles. Accounts of the inaugural games held by Titus in AD 80 describe it being filled with water for a display of specially trained swimming horses and bulls. There is also an account of a re-enactment of a famous sea battle between the Corcyrean (Corfiot) Greeks and the Corinthians. This has been the subject of some debate among historians; although providing the water would not have been a problem, it is unclear how the arena could have been waterproofed, nor would there have been enough space in the arena for the warships to move around. It has been suggested that the reports either have the location wrong or that the Colosseum originally featured a wide floodable channel down its central axis (which would later have been replaced by the hypogeum)</p>

    <h2>4.Modern Day</h2>
    <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; T</span>oday, the Colosseum is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions, receiving millions of visitors annually. It is also an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and its architectural and engineering prowess. Despite its age and the damage it has suffered over the centuries, the Colosseum remains a testament to the ingenuity and ambition of the Roman Empire.</p>
    <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; R</span>ecent restoration efforts have focused on preserving the structure and making it safe for visitors. These efforts include cleaning the exterior, reinforcing the walls, and installing new walkways and viewing platforms. The Colosseum is also used for cultural events, such as concerts and reenactments, bringing its history to life for modern audiences.</p><hr>

    <h2>5.Total Floors</h2>
    <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; T</span>he Colosseum originally had four main floors. The first three floors had arcades with 80 entrances each, while the fourth floor had small rectangular windows. The structure also included a basement level, known as the hypogeum, which housed animals and gladiators before they appeared in the arena. The total height of the Colosseum is approximately 48 meters (157 feet).</p>
    <p><span style='font-size:1.5em;'>&#8594; T</span>he Colosseum could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators, making it one of the largest amphitheaters in the Roman Empire. The seating arrangements were divided into different sections based on social class, with the best seats reserved for the emperor and other dignitaries. The Colosseum also featured a retractable awning, known as the velarium, which could be used to provide shade for spectators on hot days.</p><hr>
